Description: Bayesian estimations of a covariance matrix for multivariate 
        normal data. Assumes that the covariance matrix is sparse or band 
        matrix and positive-definite. Methods implemented include the beta-mixture 
        shrinkage prior (Lee et al. (2022) <doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2022.105067>), 
        screened beta-mixture prior (Lee et al. (2024) <doi:10.1214/24-BA1495>), 
        and post-processed posteriors for banded and sparse covariances 
        (Lee et al. (2023) <doi:10.1214/22-BA1333>; Lee and Lee (2023) 
        <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2023.105475>). This software has been developed using
